    <!--
        where to keep js file ????
        depends  on how you want to use it
      *  if we want to select the classes , id aur any of such stuff then it
        make sense to keep it at the end of the file
      *  if the  webspage is structured in such a way that you want it to load before 
         html then it makes sense to keep it in the head sections


          THERE IS NO DEFINTE ANSWER TO IT..
